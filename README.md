### Hello, I'm Yun ✨

I'm a self-employed **full stack web developer** located in Burnaby, BC. 
Currently, I thrive in a dynamic and fast-paced team environment, with a focus on team management and supervision within the video gaming industry.

My passion lies in creating my own projects and seamlessly integrating new features I've learned.
